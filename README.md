## Chrome Sessions

Chrome saves your current session as well as your last session in the User Data folder

With these bat scripts you can copy those sessions into here to back them up, as well as restore the current or last session that you have saved

copy_here.bat copies the current and last session into this folder, and makes copies of the previous versions into the "old" folder, and copies of the "old" into the "older" folder, so there's a few versions saved

You can use "restoreCurrent.bat" and it will restore the session using "Current Session" and "Current Tabs"

You can use "restoreLast.bat" and it will restore the session using "Last Session" and "Last Tabs"
